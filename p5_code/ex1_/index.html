<h2> Exercise 1 </h2>


 </p>
 <p>  I experimented with different code examples from class to make a fun space where you can play around with dynamic shapes <br>
  and changing colors. I also explored using random values to change the background color depending on the mouse position. <br>
  One of the coolest features is that you can move the "ghost" character across the screen and see a variety of wacky and <br>
  playful effects like rotating arcs and shaky balls. The visuals refresh as you move the mouse, which removes the past drawings <br>
  for a constantly changing display. The most fun part for me is seeing how the ghost and shapes react to mouse movements, creating <br>
  funny and abstract visuals. Although getting the background and effects to work smoothly took some effort, I learned a lot by tweaking the code over time. <br>
  The challenge I faced was figuring out how to smoothly move the ghost while keeping everything responsive.</p>
