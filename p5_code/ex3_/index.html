<h1> Ghost Mayham </h1>
<p>
  This version of the exercise features four ghosts with different behaviors. The red ghost moves normally without rotating, while the pink ghost <br>rotates slowly and leaves a colorful trail. 
  The green ghost is bigger and moves slowly, also leaving a trail. The yellow ghost is both big and fast, rotating <br>quickly and leaving a trail too. The trails change color randomly, making the visuals more interesting. All the ghosts bounce off the edges of the canvas<br> and follow the mouse, creating a fun, interactive effect. The code is organized into simple parts to make everything work smoothly.
